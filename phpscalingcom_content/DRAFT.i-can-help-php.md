**March 2020 - It's a crazy time** right now. We should all do what we can to help each other, But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. If you have a PHP based website that needs help to be able to keep up with the amount of traffic, I may be able to help, and will happily discuss your situation, and make some suggestions, or help you make the changes that can help.

Contact me by email at [alister@phpscaling.com](mailto:alister@phpscaling.com).

I helped [Class Central](https://www.classcentral.com/) move hosting providers a few months ago, before current events. After the optimisations I suggested, and implemented, I'm very happy to say that they've been so useful for people to find education resources.
