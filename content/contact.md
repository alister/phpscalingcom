I can be contacted in a number of ways.

* Preferred: Email [abulman@gmail.com](mailto:abulman@gmail.com)
* Mastodon: [https://hachyderm.io/@Alister](https://hachyderm.io/@Alister)
* [abulman.co.uk](https://abulman.co.uk)
* Twitter: [@alister_b](https://twitter.com/alister_b)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6216/alister-bulman)

Or just [Google me](https://www.google.com/search?q=alister+bulman). One of the advantages of a distinctive name, I'm very, very searchable. In fact, Google can even correct misspellings - just add 'php' to your search terms.

<!-- Do note however, there are people with similar – but not exact – names. Some of these people are not nice, and so it is very important to me that you spell 'Alister' correctly. If I mis-named you, that would be disrespectful and I would want to be correct, and respectful, I would just ask you to do the same for me.
