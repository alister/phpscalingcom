Just a quick note to point out a couple of presentations on Queuing. I've recently shown the second (which admittedly has some significant things in common with the original, and not just the web-based slides).

Either way, you are welcome to look at them online, and the original html source, and some source code, are all online at [http://github.com/alister](http://github.com/alister)
