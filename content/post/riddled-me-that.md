Well go figure. I’ve just won $50 (Canadian, that’s about $3000 USD by now) of books and ‘stuff’ from [PHP Arch](http://phparch.com/), care of its publisher, [Marco Tabini's, blog](http://blog.tabini.ca/2008/04/riddle-me-this-and-win-50-in-phparchitect-coupons/).

He’d put a little puzzle up last night, some long numbers, and a few short. I recognised them as almost ISBNs – it wasn’t hard to figure them as having dropped a zero from the front, making them “php|architect’s Guide to Programming with Zend Framework” and “php|architect’s Zend PHP 5 Certification Study Guide, 2nd Edition”. From there, guessing the other numbers were page, line and word counts was easy.

So, what should I buy? I’ve already got a subscription to the magazine – PDF edition (it’s so much easier to ship bits over the atlantic...).
