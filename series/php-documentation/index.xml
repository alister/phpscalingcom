            see my previous post on the topic, #1.
My last post ended up more as a how-to than what-to. This time, I&#39;ll say why you should have local copies of the documentation for most of the tools you use. I&#39;ll also tell you the sort of things I always have handy as well.
Getting a local copy of php.net - and getting installed as an apache vhost and updated (probably weekly) is some effort, but well worth it.

            As I mentioned in my second post, ZCE prep – and dumb tests - about open book tests (like Brainbench), having a copy of all the relevant documentation can be incredibly useful, if only from a speed issue. Knowing you can just open a new tab and type a few words to get the information on a function, or concept from the manual takes away so many problems.
I mentioned there that I have a local copy of the main PHP manual – and I wanted to tell you how I keep it, and a couple of other manuals up to date, as well as other documentation.
