Recruiters: Here's the rules.
The first recruiter to tell me the company name, and then send the job-spec gets to forward my details - if I think it's interesting. No company name, or spec, no chance If you send my details without my OK, you lose. And I tell the company you are a loser (chances are, they are too). Sending me all the information I could want to know is good - but when you do it on spec (and probably en-mass as well), does not mean that you get to claim the bounty.</description></item><item><title>Hire quickly, because your competitors will.</title><link>https://phpscaling.com/post/hire-quickly-because-your-competitors-will/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2012 13:11:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://phpscaling.com/post/hire-quickly-because-your-competitors-will/</guid><description>
If you aren't taking hiring seriously - other people can, and do hire the people you need.
I've been guilty of it before - leaving it a couple of days - or even a week before getting back to someone that sent in their CV - although of course, most of the time, it didn't matter. The person wasn't going to get hired because they were just not good enough (the generally poor quality of developers is a different rant).</description></item></channel></rss>
