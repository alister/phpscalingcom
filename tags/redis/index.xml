Thus far, I've not done anything serious with much more with database like Mysql, some Postgres and on the NoSql side MongoDB (with a frisson of some use of Redis for some barely-more-than basic things), but I saw some mention of using RedisGraph PHP Client back in late October, as part of my regular scan of the packagist feed for new PHP/Composer packages.
The 'kjdev/redis-graph' package is the first example of an interface library to RedisGraph - an extension module to Redis that became possible with Redis 4.</description></item></channel></rss>
