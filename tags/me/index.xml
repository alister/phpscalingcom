            I&#39;ve been pretty busy in the last couple of years, first at Binweevils and in 2011, PeerIndex - hence the utter lack of posts, but as the note on my personal CV site says, I&#39;m taking some time off between looking for my next role. This does give the opportunity to write more of PHP Scaling and the tools around development that I&#39;ve been using in the last couple of years, and that have been piquing my curiosity.

            Phew. That would have been embarrassing if I&#39;d not passed my ZCE on Thursday afternoon (Jun 4th, 2009).

            Back at the PHP London Conference at the end of February, iBuildings was offering a little test, with prize for people that could do well answering the sort of questions that are on the ZCE exam. Never one to turn down something useful for free, I took ten minutes to answer the eight questions. A few weeks later, I get an email from them/Zend to say I&#39;d won the chance to take an exam – ZCE, or ZFE (Zend Framework).

            Well, I&#39;ve just completed the PHP Arch &#39;Vulcan&#39; practice test – the first of up to five such practice tests I&#39;ve purchased. I have quite deliberately not gone through what study materials I have on hand before I took this test (I wanted to get a baseline), but none the less got an &#39;EXCELLENT&#39; final score, and the same &#39;Excellent&#39; on seven of the twelve sections the pre-test is broken down into.
