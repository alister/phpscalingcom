I've been pretty busy in the last couple of years, first at Binweevils and in 2011, PeerIndex - hence the utter lack of posts, but as the note on my personal CV site says, I'm taking some time off between looking for my next role. This does give the opportunity to write more of PHP Scaling and the tools around development that I've been using in the last couple of years, and that have been piquing my curiosity.</description></item><item><title>($me instanceOf ZCE) === true</title><link>https://phpscaling.com/post/me-instanceof-zce-true/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2009 11:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://phpscaling.com/post/me-instanceof-zce-true/</guid><description>

Never one to turn down something useful for free, I took ten minutes to answer the eight questions. A few weeks later, I get an email from them/Zend to say I'd won the chance to take an exam – ZCE, or ZFE (Zend Framework).</description></item><item><title>ZCE prep - practice test #1</title><link>https://phpscaling.com/post/zce-prep-practice-test-1-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2008 21:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://phpscaling.com/post/zce-prep-practice-test-1-2/</guid><description>
Well, I've just completed the PHP Arch 'Vulcan' practice test – the first of up to five such practice tests I've purchased. I have quite deliberately not gone through what study materials I have on hand before I took this test (I wanted to get a baseline), but none the less got an 'EXCELLENT' final score, and the same 'Excellent' on seven of the twelve sections the pre-test is broken down into.</description></item></channel></rss>
