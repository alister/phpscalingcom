            A quick fun post for those of you with an Amazon Kindle - some instructions on how to a) jailbreak your reader (trivially easy), and then b) put your own wallpapers on there, so you get a more interesting &#39;screensaver&#39;.
It&#39;s really easy, no more than 20 mins and a couple of reboots/software updates. Most of the time is literally waiting for the reader to restart after you&#39;ve placed a file in the base directory.

            I&#39;ve been pretty busy in the last couple of years, first at Binweevils and in 2011, PeerIndex - hence the utter lack of posts, but as the note on my personal CV site says, I&#39;m taking some time off between looking for my next role. This does give the opportunity to write more of PHP Scaling and the tools around development that I&#39;ve been using in the last couple of years, and that have been piquing my curiosity.
