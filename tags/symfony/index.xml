            In early 2016, I suggested an addition to the SncRedis-bundle. The project itself is an fully-featured add-on (&#39;bundle&#39;) for Symfony framework projects to easily do a number of very useful interface functions between Symfony and the Redis database/cache. It can, for example, quickly enable all the sessions to be put into a Redis server, and also cache the Doctrine meta-information as well as anything else that the developer would like to cache.
