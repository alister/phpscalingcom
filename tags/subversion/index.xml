I've read http://www.svn-checkout.co.uk/2008/01/19/how-to-release-new-versions-of-websites/ via http://www.lornajane.net/posts/2008/SVN-Deployment-and-a-New-Site and while I consider revision control an essential tool (a few years ago, my job was the only one in the previous five years where I didn't have to install my own RCS), I somewhat disagree on the idea they suggest.
That first link, 'how to release new versions of websites', suggests checking out a version of the site as a working copy, (it's certainly something I've done before now), but then it goes on to use the 'svn switch' capability to move between versions (of course, they are also doing in in TortoiseSvn, and there for the live web-server is likely to be running Windows, no way I'd run a server on Windows - not even for testing).</description></item></channel></rss>
