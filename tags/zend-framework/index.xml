            see my previous post on the topic, #1.
My last post ended up more as a how-to than what-to. This time, I&#39;ll say why you should have local copies of the documentation for most of the tools you use. I&#39;ll also tell you the sort of things I always have handy as well.
Getting a local copy of php.net - and getting installed as an apache vhost and updated (probably weekly) is some effort, but well worth it.

            When you have a library, like PEAR or Zend Framework – or even just the whole PHP language library – it’s absolutely vital you know what it can do.
What you don’t know can cost you weeks of effort and pain. I found this out (again) today, but it’s not my pain – it’s an employee who was too busy deciding that the Zend Framework wasn’t suitable for a simple cron-script task, he has spent most of the last few weeks duplicating something that is not as good as what I could write – with ZF – in about an hour.
