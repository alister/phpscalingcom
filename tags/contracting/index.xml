            It&#39;s been one of those quiet spots around here for a while, so here&#39;s the catch-up on what has been happening while I was not posting.
I&#39;ve recently finished a short contract working with an agency, Transform (part of the Engine group) working with a couple of government departments. The Office Of The Public Guardian receives, checks and stores Lasting Powers of Attorney - a legal document that you write while still mentally compentant to say what you would like to happen should the worst occur, and by whom you want to do it.
