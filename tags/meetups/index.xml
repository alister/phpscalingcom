I was out last night at the The Big Xmas [bash] #, near Silicon Roundabout. It was a fun night out meeting various people, tech, business and recruiters. Oh, the shame though - I was wearing the same T-shirt as someone else - and, yes, I have indeed replaced people with small shell scripts.
Now, to the main part of what this post is about - the rant. It's not aimed at the particular event last night alone though.</description></item></channel></rss>
