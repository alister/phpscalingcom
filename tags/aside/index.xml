            Recruiters: Here&#39;s the rules.
The first recruiter to tell me the company name, and then send the job-spec gets to forward my details - if I think it&#39;s interesting. No company name, or spec, no chance If you send my details without my OK, you lose. And I tell the company you are a loser (chances are, they are too). Sending me all the information I could want to know is good - but when you do it on spec (and probably en-mass as well), does not mean that you get to claim the bounty.

      <title>Jailbreaking your Kindle, and putting new &#39;screensaver&#39; images</title>

            A quick fun post for those of you with an Amazon Kindle - some instructions on how to a) jailbreak your reader (trivially easy), and then b) put your own wallpapers on there, so you get a more interesting &#39;screensaver&#39;.
It&#39;s really easy, no more than 20 mins and a couple of reboots/software updates. Most of the time is literally waiting for the reader to restart after you&#39;ve placed a file in the base directory.

            I was out last night at the The Big Xmas [bash] #, near Silicon Roundabout. It was a fun night out meeting various people, tech, business and recruiters. Oh, the shame though - I was wearing the same T-shirt as someone else - and, yes, I have indeed replaced people with small shell scripts.
Now, to the main part of what this post is about - the rant. It&#39;s not aimed at the particular event last night alone though.

            Phew. That would have been embarrassing if I&#39;d not passed my ZCE on Thursday afternoon (Jun 4th, 2009).
