            I&#39;ve been pretty busy in the last couple of years, first at Binweevils and in 2011, PeerIndex - hence the utter lack of posts, but as the note on my personal CV site says, I&#39;m taking some time off between looking for my next role. This does give the opportunity to write more of PHP Scaling and the tools around development that I&#39;ve been using in the last couple of years, and that have been piquing my curiosity.
