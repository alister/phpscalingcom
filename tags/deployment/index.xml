            Capistrano, makes deployment of code easy. If you need to do a number of additional steps as well, then the fact that they can be scripted and run automatically is a huge win.
If you&#39;ve only got a single machine (or maybe two), then you could certainly write your own quite simple, and entirely workable system - I described something just like this in a previous post: &amp;quot;SVN checkouts vs exports for live versions&amp;quot;.
